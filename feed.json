				"content_html": "<p>I’ve learned so much from Snap!Con2020 (the annual conference for <a href=\"https://snap.berkeley.edu\">Snap!</a> – a blocks-based language), the sister of <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu\">Scratch</a>. Our current lives dictated that it be held online, which has had the good side-effect (they’re not always bad) – an opening-up of access to participants, who would not have been to able attend in person. This year’s conference was held at Berkeley, California.</p>\n\n<p>One session was an introduction to MicroBlocks, a blocks-based language which has been designed so it can run on small controllers and can be used for physical computing (doing things in the real world; like flashing lights, driving motors for robots). This means that you can write a program, try it out on your controller and then run it untethered from the computer, say as part of an installation (the Arts kind).</p>\n\n<p>Eager to try it out afterwards (that’s going to be a feature of many things I saw at Snap!Con2020), I built a little project, as demoed in this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zosho/status/1289575155497238532\">tweet</a>. This note is by way of a <em>bill of materials</em> which I used to make it, basically by following the excellent instructions produced by the makers of the component parts. And maybe there'll be some follow ups as I play with new features.</p>\n\n<h2>What it uses</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a Raspberry Pi to run a <em>WebThings</em> gateway to provide a hub to send commands to the micro:bit. I used a Raspberry Pi 3 B (I tried the model 4, but the Mozilla software doesn’t seem to have been updated for it yet.) A Raspberry Pi 3 A+ should also work fine. The gateway opens the route to lots of WebThings possiblities.</li>\n<li>a BBC <a href=\"https://www.microbit.org\">micro:bit</a> as the ‘physical device’. Though a few years old, it is really good value, with and array of LEDs to control, and sensors such as an accelerometer. Also a set of crocodile clip friendly connectors to add buzzers etc.</li>\n<li>the micro:bit is not complete without the totally <em>kawaii</em> <a href=\"https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/kittenbot-silicone-kitty-case-for-micro-bit-orange\">KittenBot</a> Kitty case</li>\n<li>micro-USB cable to connect micro:bit to computer for writing and downloading code, and connecting to the Pi gateway when live</li>\n<li>a microSD card (8/16G fine).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/e9962b8ef2.jpg\" alt=\"connection diagram for components\" />\n</figure>\n\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n\n<p>The 5x5 LED array on the micro:bit can be switched on and off from the gateway (or over the internet). Nothing more, nothing less ;-) This note doesn’t cover the detail of the gateway, but I’ll plan to cover this separately; it’s going to be an important development for the web.</p>\n\n<h2>Steps</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>set up your WebThings gateway as per Mozilla instructions, you should be able to access the user controls at <a href=\"http://gateway.local\">http://gateway.local</a>. You will need to add a MicroBlocks <em>add-on</em> from <em>Settings</em>.</li>\n<li>download the <a href=\"http://microblocks.fun/download\">MicroBlocks software</a> for your computer</li>\n<li>plug in the micro:bit to a USB port on your computer and update its firmware in the MicroBlocks editor</li>\n<li>create the blocks-first try the small local control block, just to prove you can flash the led. Then add the main loop blocks.

				"content_text": "<p>I’ve learned so much from Snap!Con2020 (the annual conference for <a href=\"https://snap.berkeley.edu\">Snap!</a> – a blocks-based language), the sister of <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu\">Scratch</a>. Our current lives dictated that it be held online, which has had the good side-effect (they’re not always bad) – an opening-up of access to participants, who would not have been to able attend in person. This year’s conference was held at Berkeley, California.</p>\n\n<p>One session was an introduction to MicroBlocks, a blocks-based language which has been designed so it can run on small controllers and can be used for physical computing (doing things in the real world; like flashing lights, driving motors for robots). This means that you can write a program, try it out on your controller and then run it untethered from the computer, say as part of an installation (the Arts kind).</p>\n\n<p>Eager to try it out afterwards (that’s going to be a feature of many things I saw at Snap!Con2020), I built a little project, as demoed in this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zosho/status/1289575155497238532\">tweet</a>. This note is by way of a <em>bill of materials</em> which I used to make it, basically by following the excellent instructions produced by the makers of the component parts. And maybe there'll be some follow ups as I play with new features.</p>\n\n<h2>What it uses</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a Raspberry Pi to run a <em>WebThings</em> gateway to provide a hub to send commands to the micro:bit. I used a Raspberry Pi 3 B (I tried the model 4, but the Mozilla software doesn’t seem to have been updated for it yet.) A Raspberry Pi 3 A+ should also work fine. The gateway opens the route to lots of WebThings possiblities.</li>\n<li>a BBC <a href=\"https://www.microbit.org\">micro:bit</a> as the ‘physical device’. Though a few years old, it is really good value, with and array of LEDs to control, and sensors such as an accelerometer. Also a set of crocodile clip friendly connectors to add buzzers etc.</li>\n<li>the micro:bit is not complete without the totally <em>kawaii</em> <a href=\"https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/kittenbot-silicone-kitty-case-for-micro-bit-orange\">KittenBot</a> Kitty case</li>\n<li>micro-USB cable to connect micro:bit to computer for writing and downloading code, and connecting to the Pi gateway when live</li>\n<li>a microSD card (8/16G fine).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/e9962b8ef2.jpg\" alt=\"connection diagram for components\" />\n</figure>\n\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n\n<p>The 5x5 LED array on the micro:bit can be switched on and off from the gateway (or over the internet). Nothing more, nothing less ;-) This note doesn’t cover the detail of the gateway, but I’ll plan to cover this separately; it’s going to be an important development for the web.</p>\n\n<h2>Steps</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>set up your WebThings gateway as per Mozilla instructions, you should be able to access the user controls at <a href=\"http://gateway.local\">http://gateway.local</a>. You will need to add a MicroBlocks <em>add-on</em> from <em>Settings</em>.</li>\n<li>download the <a href=\"http://microblocks.fun/download\">MicroBlocks software</a> for your computer</li>\n<li>plug in the micro:bit to a USB port on your computer and update its firmware in the MicroBlocks editor</li>\n<li>create the blocks-first try the small local control block, just to prove you can flash the led. Then add the main loop blocks.  Before unplugging the micro:bit and connecting to a USB port on the Pi, ensure you've deleted the first small local control block you wrote-it's proved its point (its presence seems to upset the WebThings operation).</li>\n<li>from the <a href=\"http://gateway.local/things\"><em>Things</em> page</a> add your new IoT device (<em>+</em>)</li>\n<li>now you should be able to control it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/2c7749fa08.jpg\" alt=\"code blocks\" />\n</figure>\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://microblocks.fun/learn\">MicroBlocks activity card</a> - I used this as the basis of my blocks sketch.
